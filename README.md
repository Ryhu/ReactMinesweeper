# ReactMinesweeper
Minesweeper in React

process:
first, create the containers:
board for the entire thing,
sizeInput for the input of height, width, Mines
Grid for actual clickable game board,
Tile for the clickable tiles

first up is the input, make the input send data to the Grid component


create basic tile, has size, background color, borders
next step is to add functionality, try to multiply tiles by grid data
before that, an array has to be generated.

to save processing power, the array will be generated before the render is done.
mines have to be put on the board, and then the numbers are added based on the mines.

for randomness, upon array creation, each square will have a  ((# of mines) / (board size)) chance of being a mine.
a counter will increment with the creation process.
at the end, if counter >  mines, then all mine squares will be gathered, put into an array, shuffled, and extra mines will be poped out of the mines array. those coordinates will then be changed to empties

if counter < mines, then all empties will be arrayed, shuffled, and excess will be popped out, and changed.

After the mine laying process, the array will be looped through and numbered based on surrounding mines.

Only after the array is done will it be rendered.

...vs brute force

make 1d array, height x width long. first x slots are mines, x =  # of mines. array is then shuffled and cut into 2x array
shuffle = fisher-yates
